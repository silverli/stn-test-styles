# Test Stanford Styles

## Getting Started

- `npm install` - Install all node dependencies
- `npm start` - Compile a CSS build and watch for changes in the existing `.scss` files, and start the express server for `localhost:3000`

## Testing

- `npm test` - Run linting and Sass True tests

### Sass True

We use the [Sass True](https://github.com/oddbird/true) testing framework to test our Sass function and mixins.

### Linting

We use [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) to lint all of our Sass code to maintain a consistent code style. 

Our linting rules use the [Sparkbox Stylelint Config](https://github.com/sparkbox/stylelint-config-sparkbox) as a base for our linting rules.

### Decanter Integration

This theme aims to **partially** integrate [Decanter](https://github.com/SU-SWS/decanter). Instead of rendering all the styles generated by Decanter we:

- Import variables, function and mixins
- Compile various helpers classes
- Compile specific components such as Brand Bar, Logo, Lockup and Footer
